‘Connecting people over food & to enjoy meals inside someone else's home - MeetYourFood.com”
----------------------------------------
How many people around the world have a dream to open their own restaurant, a food joint or small snack shop? How many people love cooking, meeting new people and love talking about their tradition? How many people travelling, living or sometimes to distract themselves out of mundane routine want to enjoy food that isn’t from a restaurant nor from their kitchen? We believe there are many people who want to be on either side and there aren’t too many platforms for them to live their dream. Our business proposal is to make a marketplace for people who love food & meet people who love cooking and offering it at their home.

Objective of the project
---------------------------
1) On MYF, people who love cooking (called as HOST); are available once a week, month or forever can post about their food OR What they can cook, what are they good at OR would they like to have a breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper or are they with happy packing OR are they offering free or do they want to trade?
2) People who are interested in eating (called as Guest) can look for available options, signup and book a deal, & enjoy authentic, sometimes quick, novel or who knows a healthy food.
3) Authenticity of Guest & Host can be confirmed by: Reviews, Feedbacks, Social Identity, Description, Images (if any)

Unique features/functionality
-------------------------------------
1) Transportation - After the user selects the meal, user will get the option to avail cab pickup and drop facility within the website
2) User Profiling - Generate detailed profile by harnessing data from social websites like Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and share with HOST & GUEST; helping in identity authentication
3) Shopping - Suggest items that guest would be interested in buying e.g. Recipe ingredients, utensils & traditional & cultural artefacts
4) Suggestions - Based on your past meals and your interest suggest people relevant deals
5) Ubiquitous presence – Our solution is a scalable platform, and is available on multiple devices and across all major platforms so that users get the same experience on any device.
6) Health Conscious – By using ‘FatSecret’ API, we are giving the users with the option to see the nutritional information for each ingredient that goes into making the dishes, so the users can not only know their calorie-intake, but can also plan their diet
7) Guest Chefs - The concept is very novel - inviting guest chef’s to your restaurant and hosting on MYF by creating an event & inviting people to book the event. Restaurant owners can invite guest chefs to their restaurants, frequency as its suits them. Selection of Guest chefs will not be covered by our portal. The concept is similar to website selling tickets for a concert as artists are invited to perform in a concert similarly guest chefs will be invited to restaurants and people can book event via MYF.
